Twitter Client with Animations and Gestures
================

This is an Android demo application for using Animations and Gestures. 

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

Completed User Stories:

  x Each activity launched should use a custom activity transition on the forward and back animations.
  
  x Switching between home timeline and mentions timeline should use custom fragment transition animations on forward and back.
  
  x When pressing "compose", window should slide down from the top and then after posting should dismiss by sliding up out of
  view.
  
    Swiping one your own tweets to the right should bring up a confirm dialog asking if you'd like to delete it.

Unfortunately I wasn't sure how to embed the .gif into the ReadMe lol.
